# SubstitutePlanNotifierAEG
With this python script you can detect whether there is a new AEG BÃ¶blingen substitute plan public or not.



## Credits and info

This whole project is based on the work of [denniskeller](https://github.com/denniskeller). 
He was the one that helped me create this python script and every now and then still helps me.
Thx :smile: :thumbsup: 

It has it's origins in the [Raspberry Pi 3 tutorial for beginners](https://github.com/AnonymerNiklasistanonym/RaspiForBeginners) repository which I and some others started recently.



## How to host this service yourself

Original this service was developed and run on a Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian.

Because the script is very simple you obviously can also use an even less performant computer that runs 24/7 and has Linux.

The script itself is not a loop that waits every 5 minutes, it gets executed - checks plans, sends mails - and quits instantly after that.

### How to add other class plans and recipients?

This is very simple because the data isn't in the script but get's loaded each time from a JSON file.

`data/websites.json`:

```json
[
	{
		"name": "6a",
		"url": "http://www.aeg-boeblingen.de/vertretungsplan/HTML/2_Ver_Kla_AEG_06A.htm",
		"recipients": ["a.cool.email@address.com", "evenmore@cool.com"]
	},
    {
		"name": "11",
		"url": "http://www.aeg-boeblingen.de/vertretungsplan/HTML/2_Ver_Kla_AEG_11.htm",
		"recipients": ["your.email@gnail.com"]
	}
]
```

Simply add another entry or email address and on the next run of the script you are ready to go.

(Obviously the "name" shouldn't be two times the same - if it is you will get errors)

### The change detection

Through the time-based job scheduler `Cron` the hosting is enabled.

Just install the GUI and run it:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install gnome-schedule  
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ gnome-schedule 
```

Then copy the script and the folder `data` into your home directory folder under `Documents/SubstitutePlanNotifierAEG`.

Now just create a new `Cron`-job with the command 
`python Documents/SubstitutePlanNotifierAEG/script.py` and say this job should be executed every 5/10/60 minutes.

### The Gmail API extension

If you want to send on every change a email to yourself or others follow this tutorial:
https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python

And follow the comments in the script so that you have for your Google account all the files to use the API (`project-name.json`, `client_secret.json`).
